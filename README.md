# customer_segmentation
MLproject_klustering

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. Using clustering techniques, we aim to identify patterns that can help businesses understand customer preferences, improve marketing strategies, and enhance customer engagement.

# About the Dataset: Customer Segmentation Dataset
 Dataset Source: Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Dataset
 File Name: Mall_Customers.csv
 Number of Rows: 200
 Number of Features (Columns): 5

## Dataset Columns and Their Meanings
CustomerID:	Unique identifier for each customer
Gender:	Customerâ€™s gender (Male/Female)
Age:	Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$):	Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100):	A score assigned based on customer spending habits (higher score means frequent/high spending)

# Why is This Dataset Useful for Clustering?
- The dataset contains numerical features (Age, Income, Spending Score), which are ideal for clustering algorithms.
- Businesses can use customer segmentation to identify different consumer groups (e.g., budget-conscious shoppers vs. high spenders).
- Helps in targeted marketing and personalized promotions based on customer segments.

# Planned Approach for Analysis
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Checking for missing values and data distribution.
 - Visualizing relationships between features using scatter plots and histograms.

2. Feature Engineering (if needed):
 - Scaling/normalizing numerical features.
 - Encoding categorical variables (Gender).

3. Applying Clustering Algorithms:
 - K-Means Clustering: To segment customers into groups.
 - Hierarchical Clustering: To compare results and find optimal clusters.

4. Visualizing Customer Segments:
 - Using scatter plots, heatmaps, and cluster visualization techniques.
